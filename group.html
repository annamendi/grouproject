                        <em>DO IT AFRAID</em>. "Fear is false evidence," she continues. "You push through it, push through the pain. Like in life. You just push through it, whatever you’re facing."
                      
                
    
                        As if the challenge of her first AVON 39 Walk in Santa Barbara wasn’t daunting enough. With the fervent support of her husband and two sons, she's walked those 39.3 miles, twice with friends and last year with the Solo Strutters, proving to her that she could, in fact, push through her fear and even double the fundraising goal of $1,800. All in the name of breast cancer, in memory of her mother, who lost her battle with breast cancer 19 years ago this year.
                      
                        

                      
                         But Michelle had one unique fear she had yet to conquer: crossing bridges. With its iconic Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco AVON 39 was going to test her resolve. "I have a real fear of bridges. And I thought, how cool would it be to conquer my fear and walk across that bridge." The metaphor was not lost on her. She was determined to transcend her greatest fear and come out on the other side of it with further proof that she could accomplish anything she set her mind to. "As I approached the bridge, I thought I'm really going to conquer this! I'm never going to have to say again 'I'm afraid of bridges!'" And so she crossed it.
